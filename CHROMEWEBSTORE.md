Copy-paste source for every field in the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard. Fields still needing your input are marked **TO DO**.

## Store Listing

**Extension Name**
Letternoxd — Not Interested for Letterboxd

(Must match manifest.json. Note: Google's guidance discourages other companies' names in the extension name. "X for [site]" is common and often accepted, but if the review flags it, rename to just "Letternoxd" and keep "for Letterboxd" in the descriptions.)

**Short Description** (103 / 132 chars)
Unofficial. Adds a Not interested filter, status badges and a one-click watchlist button to Letterboxd.

**Detailed Description** (plain text — the store strips formatting)

Hide the films you know you'll never watch. Letternoxd adds a "Not interested" button to Letterboxd, plus a filter to fade or hide those films everywhere you browse.

FEATURES
• Not interested — hover any poster and click ⃠, or click "Nah" on a film's page. Your choices are saved to a private "Not Interested" list on your own Letterboxd account, so they follow you to any computer.
• Show, fade or hide — three new choices in Letterboxd's filter menu, right next to its own "Hide watched films" options.
• One-click watchlist — add or remove a film from your watchlist straight from the poster, without opening the "…" menu.
• Status badges — a small badge on each poster shows whether you've seen it (eye), loved it (heart) or watchlisted it (clock).
• Coloured fades — with Letterboxd's "Fade watched films" on, seen films fade toward green and loved films toward orange, so you can still tell them apart.
• Changed your mind? — watching, loving or watchlisting a film automatically takes it off "Not interested".
• Seen it? — marking a film watched takes it off your watchlist.
• Instant — everything updates the moment you click, and hidden films never flash on screen.

HOW TO USE
1. Install the extension and open letterboxd.com while signed in.
2. Hover a poster and click ⃠ in its top-right corner to mark it Not interested.
3. Open the eye (filter) menu on any film grid and choose Show, Fade or Hide not interested.
4. Turn status badges on or off from the same menu.

PRIVACY
Letternoxd collects no data. It has no analytics or tracking and never contacts any server except letterboxd.com, where it makes the changes you ask for on your own account. Your filter settings stay in your browser.

PERMISSIONS
• "Read and change your data on letterboxd.com" — needed to add the buttons, badges and filters to Letterboxd pages, and to update your Not Interested list and watchlist when you click. The extension runs on no other website.

## Permissions Justification

| Permission | Type | Justification |
|------------|------|---------------|
| `https://letterboxd.com/*` | content script match (shows as host access) | Adds the Not interested button, watchlist button, status badges and Show/Fade/Hide filter to Letterboxd pages, and updates the user's own private "Not Interested" list and watchlist on Letterboxd when they click those buttons. The extension runs on no other site. |

No other permissions are requested (no tabs, storage, cookies, history or all-sites access).

**Remote code:** No. All code is bundled in the package; the extension only exchanges data (not code) with letterboxd.com.

## Privacy & Data Use

### Data Collection

**Does the extension collect user data?** No — the developer receives nothing.

What it handles, for the record (all stays between the user's browser and their own Letterboxd account):

| Data Type | Collected by developer? | Transmitted Off-Device? | Purpose | Shared with Third Parties? |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------|---------|---------------------------|
| Personally identifiable info | No | No | — | No |
| Health info | No | No | — | No |
| Financial info | No | No | — | No |
| Authentication info | No | No (uses the existing Letterboxd sign-in; never reads or stores passwords) | — | No |
| Personal communications | No | No | — | No |
| Location | No | No | — | No |
| Web history | No | No | — | No |
| User activity | No | Only to letterboxd.com, at the user's request (films they mark) | Updating the user's own list and watchlist | No |
| Website content | No | No | Reads Letterboxd pages to place buttons and badges | No |

**Judgment call:** the dashboard form asks what you *collect*. Since nothing reaches you or any third party, "none" is accurate. If a reviewer pushes back, tick "User activity" and explain it is only sent to letterboxd.com to update the user's own account.

### Data Use Certification
- [x] Data is NOT sold to third parties
- [x] Data is NOT used for purposes unrelated to the extension's core functionality
- [x] Data is NOT used for creditworthiness or lending purposes

## Review Notes

### Known Issues / Limitations
- Depends on Letterboxd's current page structure; a redesign may need an update.
- Page totals (e.g. "1,234 films") still count hidden films.
- The ad-blocker pop-up remover exists only in the developer's personal build; it is not in the published package.

### Rejection History
